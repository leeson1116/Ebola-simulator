# Ebola-simulator
Simulating the Spread of Ebola based on Cellular Automaton Model. To study the spread characteristics of Ebola, we employ the SEIR model, which can predict the various properties of the pathogen spread such as the prevalence and the duration of the epidemic. With the help of the model, we can also predict possible outbreaks and bring them under control in further discussion.
